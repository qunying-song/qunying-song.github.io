I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at University College London, hosted by Professors Federica Sarro and Mark Harman. My research focuses on testing autonomous driving systems, with particular emphasis on scenario-based testing and critical scenario identification. I earned my PhD in Computer Science from Lund University, Sweden, in 2024, under the supervision of Professor Per Runeson and Dr. Emelie Engström. Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Software Engineering from Kristianstad University, Sweden, in 2012 and 2013, respectively, and subsequently worked as a software engineer at several companies, including Ericsson, Alibaba, and Qlik.
